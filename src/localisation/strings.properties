onStart=Welcome!\\n\nI can track any ip address to show you some informations like its _geo position_ and everything related to it such as _city_, _region_, _country_ and _zip code_ .\\n\nI can also fetch the _organization_ that ip belongs to.\\n\nFeel free to use me everytime you want! I'm always available to you via *inline query*. By the way, if you need further informations, use command /help ;)
invalid=The address you inserted is not valid.\\nUse /help command in a private chat to learn more about this bot and how it works.
onHelp=*How can I use this bot?*\\n\nI work in a very simple way: try writing here\\n\n`@ipaboutbot 8.8.8.8` \\n\\n\nAs you can see, You can choose between two options: you can get your query _full results_ or you can choose to _locate ip position_ on a google map.\\n\nNot all ip addresses provides full informations: in this case, if something is missing, I won't show the relative field. A _complete result_ includes:\\n\\n\n-_ip_\\n\n-_hostname_\\n\n-_city_\\n\n-_region_\\n\n-_country_\\n\n-_latitude_ and _longitude_\\n\n-_organisation_ (which is, intellectual property organisation)\\n\\n\n*Okay, but... what's behind this bot? How can it be so fast?*\\n\nI'm based on ipinfo.io, which provides JSON results to your query.\\n\nAll my developer had to do was to build a simple Java API to encode ipinfo JSON responses: so simple. I send the request to ipinfo website, I get the response, I encode that JSON and then I send you what you are searching for.\\n\nBy the way, ipInfo.io can run only 1000 requests each day from a unique ip address. This means that you won't get any results regardless your ip once that limit is reached. Sorry :S\\n\nAlso, notice that ipinfo.io still doesn't fully support IPv6; this is why I can only track IPv4 addresses... but they still are the most used, so there shouldn't be any problems.\\n\\n\n*WTF is an ip address?*\\n\ntake a look here: http://whatismyipaddress.com/ip-address \\n\\n\n*OMG cool! Now I'm an hacker!*\\n\n...No, _you aren't_. I don't provide enough informations to allow you to harm someone.
